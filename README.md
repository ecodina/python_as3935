# Welcome to python_as3935!

This Python module let's you control the AS3935 lightning detector. The board used is the MOD-1016 from [EmbeddedAdventures](http://www.embeddedadventures.com/as3935_lightning_sensor_module_mod-1016.html).
 
 
 1. It works with [Pigpio](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/) instead of the common [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/), in order to be able to use it without being root.
 2. The communication with the device is done via I2C serial protocol.
 3. It allows you to perform every action described in the [datasheet](http://www.embeddedadventures.com/datasheets/AS3935_Datasheet_EN_v2.pdf).
 
To install it from Pypi:
```
$ pip install as3935
```


# 1. Connection of the device
If using a [40-pin GPIO](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/) Raspberry Pi, the device should be connected as follows:

| Pin on AS3935 | Pin name on RPi | Pin number (BCM) |
|----|----|----|
| Vcc | 3.3V | Any |
| IRQ | Any available GPIO|  e.g. 4 |
| SCL | Clock | 3 |
| SDA | Data | 2 |
| GND | Ground | Any |



# 2. Requisites
## 2.1 Pigpio

Install the Pigpio daemon, either from source or via:
```
$ sudo apt install pigpio
```
 Configure *Remote GPIO* using (if on Raspbian):

```
$ sudo raspi-config
```
Enable the daemon and start it now:
```
$ sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
$ sudo systemctl start pigpiod
```
Install the [Python interface](https://pypi.org/project/pigpio/):

```
$ pip install pigpio
```

For further information, visit [Pigpio's](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpiod.html) webpage.
  
## 2.2 Python

This module has been tested on Python 3.7. It might work on other versions as well. The only library used, a part from *Pigpio*, is *time*

# 3. Usage

It is very simple to use. Just import it and create a new object with the configuration you need.

```
import as3935
import pigpio
    
irq_pin_number = 4    # BCM number (code after GPIO)
bus = 1               # On newer Raspberrys is 1
address = 0x03        # If using MOD-1016 this is the address

sensor = as3935.AS3935(irq_pin_number, bus, address)

# We need to calibrate the sensor first. Use the tuning cap provided
# or calculate it using sensor.calculate_tuning_cap(*args)
sensor.full_calibration(12)

sensor.set_indoors(True)

# Every time you sense a pulse on IRQ it means there is an
# interruption request. You can read it like this:
def irq_callback(gpio, level, tick):
    interruption = sensor.get_interrupt()
    if interruption == as3935.INT_NH:
        print("Noise floor too high")
    elif interruption == as3935.INT_D:
        print("Disturbance detected. Mask it?")
    elif interruption == as3935.INT_L:
        print("Lightning detected!")
        distance = sensor.get_distance()

try:
    cb = sensor.pi.callback(irq_pin_number, pigpio.RISING_EDGE, irq_callback)
    while True:
        pass
finally:
    cb.cancel()
    sensor.pi.stop()
```  

This above is a very simple example. Check the full documentation to learn all the methods you can call.
